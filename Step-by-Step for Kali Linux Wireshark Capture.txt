Step-by-Step for Kali Linux Wireshark Capture
1️⃣ Install Wireshark
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireshark -y
Explanation: Updates package lists and installs Wireshark.

You might be asked if non-superusers can capture packets — choose Yes to avoid needing sudo.

2️⃣ Launch Wireshark
bash
Copy
Edit
wireshark
Explanation: Opens the Wireshark GUI in Kali Linux.

3️⃣ Select Active Network Interface
In Wireshark, you’ll see a list of interfaces (like eth0, wlan0).

Pick the one with the most active traffic (usually wlan0 for Wi-Fi or eth0 for wired).

Click Start Capturing Packets (blue shark fin icon).

4️⃣ Generate Network Traffic
Open a browser and visit some websites.

Run a ping test in the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping -c 5 google.com
Explanation: Creates visible packet activity for analysis.

5️⃣ Stop Capture
In Wireshark, click the red square stop button after ~1 minute.

You now have raw packet data.

6️⃣ Apply Filters
In the Wireshark Filter Bar, try:

text
Copy
Edit
http
dns
tcp
Explanation: Shows only packets for that specific protocol.

This helps identify the types of traffic in your capture.

7️⃣ Identify Protocols
Check the "Protocol" column.

At minimum, you should see:

HTTP – Web browsing traffic.

DNS – Domain name lookups.

TCP – Transmission protocol used for web & DNS.

8️⃣ Export Capture as .pcap
Go to File → Save As

Name it network_capture.pcap

Choose PCAP file format and save.

9️⃣ Create Report
Write a small text file (capture_report.txt) summarizing:

Date & system used.

Protocols identified.

Observations (normal traffic, any anomalies).

10️⃣ Organize Files for GitHub
Final folder structure:

Copy
Edit
Wireshark-Network-Capture-Analysis/
├── README.md
├── capture_report.txt
├── network_capture.pcap
└── screenshots/
Place your real .pcap and screenshots here.
